	/// ***Only one thread at a time can call this for a particular `Lun`.***.
	///
	/// This function performs a data exchange with the reader (not the card) specified by `Lun`.
	/// It is responsible for abstracting functionality such as PIN pads, biometrics, LCD panels, etc.
	/// You should follow the MCT (Multifunctional Card Terminal) and CTBCS specifications for a list of accepted commands to implement.
	/// This function is fully voluntary and does not have to be implemented unless you want extended functionality.
	///
	/// * `Lun`:  Logical Unit Number, also called `slot`.
	/// * `dwControlCode`:  Control code for the operation. This value identifies the specific operation to be performed. This value is driver specific.
	/// * `TxBuffer`:  Transmit data
	/// * `TxLength`:  Length of this buffer.
	/// * `RxBuffer`:  Receive data.
	/// * `RxLength`:  Length of the response buffer.
	/// * `pdwBytesReturned`:  Length of response.
	///
	/// This function will be passed the length of the buffer `RxBuffer` in `RxLength` and it must set the length of the received data in `pdwBytesReturned`.
	/// On error, `pdwBytesReturned` should be set to zero.
	///
	///
	/// ## Control codes supported by the ifd-ccd.bundle driver.
