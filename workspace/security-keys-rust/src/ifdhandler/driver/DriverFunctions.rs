/// # Logical Unit Number.

/// Use this for multiple card slots or multiple readers.
/// `0xXXXXYYYY - XXXX` multiple readers, `YYYY` multiple slots.
/// The resource manager will set these automatically.
/// By default the resource manager loads a new instance of the driver so if your reader does not have more than one smart card slot then ignore the Logical Unit Number in all functions.
/// PC/SC supports the loading of multiple readers through one instance of the driver in which `XXXX` is important.

	/// * `DeviceName`: 'Filename to use by the driver' or USB string; a non-null C String with a `strlen()` greater than 0.
	///
	///
	/// ## Device Name
	///
	/// For drivers configured by `/etc/reader.conf` (the legacy Gemplus Twin Serial drivers), this is the value of the field `DEVICENAME`. For USB drivers the `DeviceName` must start with `usb:VID/PID`, where:-
	///
	/// * `VID` is the Vendor Identifier as a 4 digit lowercase hexadecimal number;
	/// * `PID` is the Product Identifier as a 4 digit lowercase hexadecimal number.
	///
	/// For example, `usb:ab12/ff00`.
	///
	///
	/// ### Additional Information for USB card readers
	///
	/// The `DeviceName` string may also contain a more specialised identification string.
	///
	/// This additional information is used to differentiate between two identical readers connected at the same time. In this case the driver cannot differentiate the two readers using Vendor Identifier and Product Identifier and PID and must use some additional information identifying the USB port used by each reader.
	///
	/// This varies whether the driver uses `libusb` or `libudev`; the latter is the new default.
	/// If a driver does not understand the additional information, it should ignore it rather than fail.
	///
	///
	/// #### `libusb`
	///
	/// For USB drivers using libusb-1.0 http://libusb.sourceforge.net/ for USB abstraction the `DeviceName` the string may be generated by the C code `printf("usb:%04x/%04x:libusb-1.0:%d:%d:%d", idVendor, idProduct, bus_number, device_address, interface)`.
	///
	/// An example might be `usb:08e6/3437:libusb-1.0:7:99:0` under Linux (this may be different for Mac OS X).
	///
	///
	/// #### `libudev`
	///
	/// If using `libudev`, the string may be generated by the C code `printf("usb:%04x/%04x:libudev:%d:%s", idVendor, idProduct, bInterfaceNumber, devpath)` where:-
	///
	/// * `bInterfaceNumber` is the number of the interface on the device. It is only useful for devices with more than one CCID interface.
	/// * `devpath` is the filename of the device on the file system; it is obtained by the API function `udev_device_get_devnode()`.
	///
	/// An example might be `usb:08e6/3437:libudev:0:/dev/bus/usb/008/047` under Linux.

	/// * `TAG_IFD_THREAD_SAFE`: If the driver supports more than one reader (check `TAG_IFD_SIMULTANEOUS_ACCESS`), then this tag indicates if the driver supports access to multiple readers at the same time. If `0`, the driver does not support simultaneous access. If `1`, it does. Returns an `u8`.

	/// * `TAG_IFD_SLOT_THREAD_SAFE`: If the reader has more than one slot (check `TAG_IFD_SLOTS_NUMBER`) this tag indicates if the driver supports access to multiple slots of the same reader at the same time. if `0`, the driver supports only 1 slot access at a time. If `1`, the driver supports simultaneous slot accesses. Returns an `u8`.
	/// * `TAG_IFD_POLLING_THREAD`: Unused / deprecated.
	/// * `TAG_IFD_POLLING_THREAD_WITH_TIMEOUT`: If the driver provides a polling thread then `Value` is a function pointer to a function with C prototype `RESPONSECODE foo(DWORD Lun, int timeout)`.
	/// * `TAG_IFD_POLLING_THREAD_KILLABLE`: Tell if the polling thread can be killed. If the value is `0`, then the driver cannot be stopped using `pthread_cancel()`; the driver must then implement support for `TAG_IFD_STOP_POLLING_THREAD`. If the value is `1`, then the driver can be stopped using `pthread_cancel()`. ***NOTE: Some documentation refers to `pthread_kill()` instead of `pthread_cancel()`.***
	/// * `TAG_IFD_STOP_POLLING_THREAD`: Returns a function pointer in `Value` to a function used to stop the polling thread returned by `TAG_IFD_POLLING_THREAD_WITH_TIMEOUT`. The function's C prototype is `RESPONSECODE foo(DWORD Lun)`.

	/// * `SCARD_ATTR_VENDOR_NAME`: Byte buffer if manufacturer is known.
	/// * `SCARD_ATTR_VENDOR_IFD_SERIAL_NO`: Byte buffer if vendor is known.
	/// * `SCARD_ATTR_CHANNEL_ID`: Returns an `u32`; top 16 bits are 0x0020, bits 8-15 are bus number and bits 0-7 are address.
	/// * `SCARD_ATTR_MAXINPUT`: Returns an `u32`.
	/// * `TAG_IFD_SIMULTANEOUS_ACCESS`: This returns a value of `CCID_DRIVER_MAX_READERS`. Frustratingly it makes no use of `Lun` but can not be called until at least one `Lun` has been created by `IFDHCreateChannel()` or `IFDHCreateChannelByName()`.

	/// ***Only one thread at a time can call this for a particular `Lun`.***.
	///
	/// This function performs an APDU exchange with the card or slot specified by Lun.
	///
	/// The driver is responsible for performing any protocol specific exchanges such as T=0, 1, etc.
	/// Calling this function will abstract all protocol differences.
	///
	/// * `Lun`: Logical Unit Number.
	/// * `SendPci`: A struct containing a `Protocol` field with a value from `0` to `14` inclusive, and an unused `Length` field.
	/// * `TxBuffer`: A buffer containing a transmit Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU), eg `[0x00, 0xA4, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x3F, 0x00]`.
	/// * `TxLength`: Length of the `TxBuffer` buffer.
	/// * `RxBuffer`: A buffer to contain a receive Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU), eg `[0x61, 0x14]`.
	/// * `RxLength`: Length of the `RxBuffer` buffer; length of the received receive Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU). Must be zero if an error occurs.
	/// * `RecvPci`:  A struct containing a `Protocol` field with a value from `0` to `14` inclusive, and an unused `Length` field.
	///
	///
	/// ## PCI
	///
	/// In the above function parameters 'Pci' has nothing to do with the PCI interface, but instead stands for Protocol Control Information.
	///
	///
	/// ## Memory Cards
	///
	/// The driver is responsible for knowing what type of card it has.
	/// If the current slot or card contains a memory card then this command should ignore  the Protocol and use the MCT (Multifunctional Card Terminal) style commands for support for these style cards and transmit them appropriately.
	/// If your reader does not support/ memory cards or you don't want to implement this functionality, then ignore this.
	///
	///
	/// ## Get Response Application Protocol Data Unit.
	///
	/// The driver is not responsible for doing an automatic Get Response command for received buffers with a status code of `0x61 0xXX`.
	///
	///
	/// # Return Codes
	///
	/// * `IFD_SUCCESS`: Successful.
	/// * `IFD_COMMUNICATION_ERROR`: Error has occurred.
	/// * `IFD_NO_SUCH_DEVICE`: The reader is no more present.
	/// * `IFD_ICC_NOT_PRESENT`: ICC is not present.
	/// * `IFD_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT`:  The response timed out.
	/// * `IFD_NOT_SUPPORTED`:  ?Transmission of APDUs is unsupported, or the chosen SendPci protocol is not supported?
