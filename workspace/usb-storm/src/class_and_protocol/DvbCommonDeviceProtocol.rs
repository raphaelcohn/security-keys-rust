/// DVD Common Interface (DVB-CI).
///
/// The DVB Common Interface (DVB-CI) specification describes a system whereby a removable CI Conditional Access Module (CICAM), given the appropriate usage rights, unscrambles protected pay-TV content and routes it over the same interface back to a TV receiver for display.
/// An interface association for a DVB-CI function will contain a DVB-CI Command Interface for command, control, and status information, it may contain a DVB-CI Media Interface for audiovisual data streams, and it may also contain a CDC EEM interface to provide bridged networking to the CICAM.
