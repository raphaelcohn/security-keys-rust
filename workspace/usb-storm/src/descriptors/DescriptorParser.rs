	/// `remaining_bytes` exclude `bLength` and `bDescriptorType` bytes, but is not sliced to be `bLength` long (`remaining_bytes.len()`); instead, it consists of all remaining bytes after `bDescriptorType`.
	/// The parser must report how many bytes it consumed, which must be at least `bLength`.
	/// This allows the end point parser to consume adjacent descriptors, rather than one at a time.
	///
	/// If the parser returns `None`, then the descriptor is unknown and is handled by the caller of `parse_descrptor()`.
	/// If the parser return `Some(descriptor, consumed_length)`, then it parsed the descriptor (and perhaps an immediately contiguous descriptor in the case of end points), and returns the total length of bytes consumed from `remaining_bytes`. This total length will not include the overhead of the first descriptor's header (`bLength` and `bDescriptorType`).
	///
	/// `remaining_bytes.len()` will always be `<= 253`.
