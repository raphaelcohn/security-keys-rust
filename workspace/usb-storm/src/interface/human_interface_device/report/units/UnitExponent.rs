/// Parsing this has a very messy and broken history of misunderstanding.

/// Summarising from a Linux commit:-
/// * This value should just be a signed integer value.
/// * However several significant sources deviate from this:-
/// 	* the offical [HID Descriptor Tool](https://www.usb.org/document-library/hid-descriptor-tool).
/// 	* Books such as "USB Complete".
/// 	* Microsoft's hardware design guides.
/// * That said, some devices do correctly set this.
